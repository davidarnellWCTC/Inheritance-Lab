Before BMW turned into a modestly unreliable and complicated car company
they used to make simple and overbuilt cars available with cloth seats
and crank windows. This progam shows which engines were used by the
3 and 5 series cars of the 80's.

The e30 generation 3 series used both the m10 and m20 engines.
the e28 generation 5 series used both the m20 and m30 engines.

/*
Additional exlanation added for the project

BMW used the chassis code "e30" for the 3 series from ±1984 to ±1991 and "e28"
for the 5 series of about the same years.

The M series of engines were all inline single-cam engines that powered these
cars.

This program is suposed to show the relationship between the different models
of the 3 and 5 series BMWs of this era as well as which engines they used.

The intention was to show how the 325i model inherits from the generation e30
in that it "is-a" e30 and that the chassis code e30 "is-a" 3 series and so on.

The M series engine blocks inherit from the same block design. The m10, m20,
and m30 engine blocks are all a part of the M engine block architecture. However,
each block is different in its implementation. They have the same objects (methods)
but their use of these methods is different.
