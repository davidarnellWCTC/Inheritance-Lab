Before BMW turned into a modestly unreliable and complicated car company
they used to make simple and overbuilt cars available with cloth seats
and crank windows. This progam shows which engines were used by the
3 and 5 series cars of the 80's.

The e30 generation 3 series used both the m10 and m20 engines.
the e28 generation 5 series used both the m20 and m30 engines.
